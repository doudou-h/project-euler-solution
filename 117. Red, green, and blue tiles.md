## **[117. Red, green, and blue tiles](https://projecteuler.net/problem=117)**

### Question
Using a combination of grey square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from: red tiles (measuring two units), green tiles (measuring three units), and blue tiles (measuring four units), it is possible to tile a row measuring five units in length in exactly fifteen different ways.

How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled?

### Solution

```python
from functools import lru_cache

def p117(n = 50):

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def f(n):
        if n <= 1: return 1
        if n == 2: return 2
        if n == 3: return 4
        return f(n - 1) + f(n - 2) + f(n - 3) + f(n - 4)

    return f(n)
```
