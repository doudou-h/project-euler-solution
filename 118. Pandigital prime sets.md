## **[118. Pandigital prime sets](https://projecteuler.net/problem=118)**

### Question
Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.

How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once contain only prime elements?

### Solution
One of my slowest solutions, takes about 12s. PyPy gives the result in 2s thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler.

Why can we ignore permutations ending with any of {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}? 

4, 6 and 8 are trivial since there is no prime number ending with them. 2 and 5 are prime numbers themselves. They can be at the end of permutations. For example, 124367|89|5. However, 2 and 5 can only form prime numbers by themselves if they're at the end. Therefore, any prime set can be found in 12436789|5 can also be found in 5|12436789.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def p118():
    N = 1000000
    primes = set(sieve(N))  # sieve function see link below

    def dfs(i, tmp):
        if i == len(s):
            ans.add(tuple(sorted(tmp)))
            return
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            num = int(''.join(s[i : j]))
            if (num > N and isprime(num)) or (num <= N and num in primes):
                dfs(j, tmp + [num])

    ans = set()
    for s in permutations('123456789'):
        if s[-1] not in {'2', '4', '5', '6', '8'}: dfs(0, [])
    return len(ans)
```

### Answer 
`44680`
