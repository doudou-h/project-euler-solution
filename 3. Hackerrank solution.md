## [Hackerrank Project Euler #3](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler003/problem)
### Question
Given `T` numbers, for each number `N`, what is `N`'s the largest prime factor?

Constraints:
- `1 <= T <= 10`
- `10 <= N <= 10^12`

### Solution
The [previous solution](./3.%20Largest%20prime%20factor.md) doesn't pass all test cases due to timeout. A minor change will improve the performance significantly. 
Because if a number `N` is not divisible by any number from `2` to `sqrt(N)`, then `N` is a prime number.

e.g. If `N = 19946`, in the first solution, `p` is increased from `2` to `9973`. In the second solution, `p` is increased from `2` to `100` therefore much faster. (`19946 = 2 * 9973`, where `9973` is the largest prime number under `10000`)

```python
def p3(N = 600851475143):
    p = 2
    while N >= p * p:
        if N % p == 0:
            N //= p
        else:
            p += 1
    return N

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    print(p3(N))
```
