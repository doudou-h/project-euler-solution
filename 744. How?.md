This page has detailed how I solved the [744. What? Where? When?](./744.%20What%3F%20Where%3F%20When%3F.md)

#### Step 1
It's easier to find the probability that the game ends abnormally, i.e. with a red card, note it as ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r(n,&space;p)).  Start from small n and see if there is any pattern here:

n = 1: there are three envelopes. The game ends no matter which card is chosen, ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r(1,&space;p)&space;=&space;1/3)

n = 2: there are five envelopes. The game ends with a red card if any of the following happens:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1st envelope contains the red card --> 1/5

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1st envelope contains a question, the expert gives the correct answer; 2nd envelope contains the red card --> 1/5 * p

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1st envelope contains a question, the expert gives the wrong answer; 2nd envelope contains the red card --> 1/5 * (1 - p)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1st envelope contains a question, the expert gives the correct answer; 2nd envelope contains a question, 
the expert gives the wrong answer; 3rd envelope contains the red card --> 1/5 * p * (1 - p)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1st envelope contains a question, the expert gives the wrong answer; 2nd envelope contains a question, 
the expert gives the correct answer; 3rd envelope contains the red card --> 1/5 * (1 - p) * p

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r(2,&space;p)&space;=&space;2/5&space;&plus;&space;2/5&space;\cdot&space;p&space;\cdot&space;(1&space;-&space;p))

n = 3: there are seven envelopes. Using the same idea, ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r(3,&space;p)&space;=&space;3/7&space;&plus;&space;3/7&space;\cdot&space;p&space;\cdot&space;(1&space;-&space;p)&space;&plus;&space;6/7&space;\cdot&space;p^2&space;\cdot&space;(1&space;-&space;p)^2)

#### Step 2
Notice that the denominator of ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r(n,&space;p)) is simply ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2n&plus;1). So it's better to focus on the numerator. Let ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x:=p\cdot&space;(1-p)) and write the numerator as a function ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(n,&space;x)), we have

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(1,x)=1)

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(2,x)=2\cdot(1&plus;x))

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(3,x)=3\cdot(1&plus;x&plus;2x^2))

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(4,x)=4\cdot(1&plus;x&plus;2x^2&plus;5x^3))

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(5,x)=5\cdot(1&plus;x&plus;2x^2&plus;5x^3&plus;14x^4))


For ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(4,x)) and ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(5,x)), the following two equations are useful

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p^2&plus;(1-p)^2=1-2p(1-p)=1-2x)

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p^3&plus;(1-p)^3=1-3p^2(1-p)-3p(1-p)^2=1-3x)

To double check my calculation above, I wrote the following piece of code which replicates the process but struggles when n is bigger than 10.
```python
from collections import deque

class Node:
    def __init__(self, up, down, prob, N, red=1):
        self.up = up  # expert's point
        self.down = down  # viewers' point
        self.prob = prob  # probability of reaching current node
        self.N = N  # remaining number of non-red normal envelopes
        self.red = red  # if current is red


class Game:
    def __init__(self, n, p):
        self.n = n
        self.p = p
        self.res = 0.0  # probability of game ending normally

    def calculate(self):
        root = Node(0, 0, 1.0, 2 * self.n, 0)
        dq = deque([root])
        while dq:
            node = dq.popleft()
            if node.red:
                continue
            if node.up == self.n or node.down == self.n:
                self.res += node.prob
                continue
            up, down, prob, N = node.up, node.down, node.prob, node.N
            dq.append(Node(up, down, prob / (N + 1), N, 1))
            dq.append(Node(up + 1, down, self.p * prob * N / (N + 1), N - 1, 0))
            dq.append(Node(up, down + 1, (1 - self.p) * prob * N / (N + 1), N - 1, 0))
        return self.res

def v1(n, p):
    """replicates the process
    becomes slow when n > 10"""
    g = Game(n, p)
    return g.calculate()
```

#### Step 3

The coefficients in ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R(n,&space;x)) seem to have a pattern. From [List of integer sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integer_sequences), I found [Catalan number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number). So I implemented the `v2()` below and it gives the same answer as `v1()` above for small n. However, it doesn't work when n is bigger than 520 since it involves large factorials.

```python
from math import comb

def catalan(k):
    return comb(2 * k, k) / (k + 1)

def v2(n, p):
    """only works for n <= 520
    otherwise OverflowError"""
    x = p * (1 - p)
    y = sum(catalan(k) * pow(x, k) for k in range(n))
    return 1 - y * n / (2 * n + 1)
```

#### Step 4

It is in this [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number#First_proof) that I found the answer!

![eq](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c248b720d4b35bbfe1a6c9a479da09786d72256a)

Setting y = -4x helps produce the final code below. 

```python
def p744(n, p):
    """only works for large n"""
    x = p * (1 - p)
    y = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4 * x)) / (2 * x)
    return 1 - y * n / (2 * n + 1)
```

#### Final words

A bit of hard work (step 1 and step 2) and a bit of luck (step 3 and step 4). Solving Project Euler is possible.
