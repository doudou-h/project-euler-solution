## **[78. Coin partitions](https://projecteuler.net/problem=78)**

### Question
Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.

Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.

### Solution
Very similar to [76. Counting summations](./76.%20Counting%20summations.md). Is this another "copy and paste" just like [77. Prime summations](./77.%20Prime%20summations.md? Definitely not!
