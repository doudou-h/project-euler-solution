## **[78. Coin partitions](https://projecteuler.net/problem=78)**

### Question
Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.

Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.

### Solution
Naively thought this is another "copy and paste" problem just like [77. Prime summations](./77.%20Prime%20summations.md). However, the number is much larger here. If we look at the solution of [76. Counting summations](./76.%20Counting%20summations.md), to calculate `f(n)`, we use pre-calculated/cached values so that `f(n)` is obtained through n operations i.e. O(n). This becomes incredibly slow when n gets large. 

One of the ways to solve this problem is to use [Pentagonal number theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem), where

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p(n)=(-1)^{k-1}\sum&space;p(n-g(k)),\texttt{where&space;}g(k)=\frac{k(3k-1)}{2},&space;k=\pm&space;1,&space;\pm&space;2,&space;...)

Also, ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p(n)=0&space;\texttt{&space;for&space;}&space;n&space;<&space;0)

```python
def p78():

    def partition(n):
        pn = 0
        for k in range(1, n + 1):
            gk = k * (3 * k - 1) // 2
            if gk > n: break
            pn += (-1) ** (k - 1) * p[n - gk]

            k *= -1
            gk = k * (3 * k - 1) // 2
            if gk > n: break
            pn += int((-1) ** (k - 1)) * p[n - gk]
        p[n] = pn
        return pn

    n, pn = 0, 1
    p={n: pn}
    while pn % 1000000 != 0:
        n += 1
        pn = partition(n)
    return n
```
