## **[686. Powers of Two](https://projecteuler.net/problem=686)**

### Question
![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^7=128) is the first power of two whose leading digits are "12".
The next power of two whose leading digits are "12" is ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^{80}).

Define p(L, n) to be the nth-smallest value of j such that the base 10 representation of 
![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^j) begins with the digits of L.
So p(12, 1) = 7 and p(12, 2) = 80.

You are also given that p(123, 45) = 12710. Find p(123, 678910).


### Solution
The solution is to find integer k such that
![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1.23\times10^i\leq2^k<1.24\times10^i)

which is equivalent of 
![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?log_2(1.23)+i{\cdot}log_2(10){\leq}k<log_2(1.24)+i{\cdot}log_2(10))

Again, pypy reduces time massively running the code below from 1min to 0.3sec.

```python
def p686(n=678910):
    LOG2_123 = log(1.23, 2)
    LOG2_124 = log(1.24, 2)
    LOG2_10 = log(10, 2)

    i, j = 0, 0
    while j < n:
        l = int(LOG2_123 + i * LOG2_10 + 1)
        m = int(LOG2_124 + i * LOG2_10)

        if j + (m - l + 1) >= n:
            return n + l - j - 1
        else:
            j += m - l + 1
        i += 1
```

### Note

Calculating `log` is expensive. The time needed for 10 million (1e7) calls:

| Log             | Time |
|-----------------|------|
| log(1)          | 2s   |
| log(1, 2)       | 3s   |
| log(1) / log(2) | 4s   |
