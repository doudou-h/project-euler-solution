## **[115. Counting block combinations II](https://projecteuler.net/problem=115)**

### Question
A row measuring n units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of m units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.

Let the fill-count function, F(m, n), represent the number of ways that a row can be filled.

For example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.

That is, for m = 3, it can be seen that n = 30 is the smallest value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

In the same way, for m = 10, it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711 and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so n = 57 is the least value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

For m = 50, find the least value of n for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

### Solution
```python
from functools import lru_cache

def p115(m = 50, limit = 1000000):

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def f(n):
        if n <= m - 1: return 1
        res = f(n - 1)           # a black first
        for i in range(m, n):
            res += f(n - i - 1)  # red followed by a black
        return res + 1           # all red no black

    n = m + 1
    while f(n) <= limit: n += 1
    return n
```

### Answer 
`168`
