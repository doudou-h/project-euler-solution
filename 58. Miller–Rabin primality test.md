## [58. Miller–Rabin primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller–Rabin_primality_test)

Miller–Rabin primality test is mentioned in the [forum](https://projecteuler.net/thread=58). If we replace the naive [isprime](https://github.com/doudou-h/doudou-h.github.io/blob/main/project-euler-solution/7.%2010001st%20prime.md) function in the [previous solution](https://github.com/doudou-h/doudou-h.github.io/blob/main/project-euler-solution/58.%20Spiral%20primes.md) with the `is_prime_miller_rabin` below, we'll get the answer in 1s instead of 5s. So what is the Miller–Rabin primality test?

### Idea
Let's assume that we want to have a test to determine whether a given football player is **likely** to be Cristiano Ronaldo. How do we do? We can start from listing some of his spectacular facts: he has scored [more than 500 goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_footballers_with_500_or_more_goals); he has won [Ballon d'Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d%27Or) more than three times... Based on the facts, we can design our test as follows: 

Given a player, assume that he/she is Cristiano Ronaldo. Then they should score more than 500 goals and win Ballon d'Or more than three times. If they fail to achieve any of the two, returns False; otherwise returns True. 

```python
def is_cristiano(player: Player):
    if player.goals <= 500: 
        return False
    if player.ballon_dOr <= 3:
        return False
    return True
```

Let's do some sanity check:
- If the player is Cristiano Ronaldo, the test returns True :white_check_mark:
- If the player is Zlatan Ibrahimović, the test returns False (even though he's scored more than 500 goals) :white_check_mark:
- If the player is Neymar, the test returns False :white_check_mark:
- If the player is Lionel Messi, the test returns True :x:

Our test gives the wrong answer when the given player is Messi. Does it mean that this is a bad test? No, the test error is only 0.001% assuming that there are 100,000 professional football players in the world. The error is much lower if we consider all (professional and amateur) football players in the world. Therefore, it is not a bad probabilistic test.


### Prime facts
Using a similar idea, we list two of prime number's important facts (in maths we call them properties)
- [Fermat's little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem): If p is a prime and 1 <= a < p, then ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^{p-1}-1) is divisible by p
- [Euclid's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_lemma):  If a prime p divides the product ab of two integers a and b, then p must divide at least one of those integers a and b.

### Proof
If we assume that a given number n is a prime, then based on the Fermat's little theorem: for 1 <= a < n, ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^{n-1}-1) is divisible by n. If n > 2, n - 1 is even. We have ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^{n-1}-1=(a^{(n-1)/2}-1)(a^{(n-1)/2}&plus;1)). In fact, we can write n as ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?d\cdot&space;2^{s}&space;&plus;&space;1), where d is odd, then

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^{n-1}-1=(a^{(n-1)/2^s}-1)(a^{(n-1)/2^s}&plus;1)(a^{(n-1)/2^{s-1}}&plus;1)\cdot&space;\cdot&space;\cdot&space;(a^{(n-1)/2}&space;&plus;&space;1))

which is equivalent to 

![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^{n-1}-1=(a^d-1)(a^d&plus;1)(a^{d\cdot&space;2}&space;&plus;&space;1)\cdot&space;\cdot&space;\cdot&space;(a^{d\cdot&space;2^{s-1}}&plus;1))

Since ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^{n-1}-1) is divisible by n, according to Euclid's lemma, n must divide at least one of these: ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^d-1), ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^d&plus;1). ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^{d\cdot&space;2}-1),..., ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^{d\cdot&space;2^{s-1}}-1). If n doesn't divide any of those, then n is NOT a prime.

### Accuracy 
Given a composite number, the test has a more than 75% chance to declare n as a composite, which means it has at most 25% (=![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4^{-1})) chance to declare it as a prime. That sounds bad, doesn't it? In fact no. Because we can pick another a such that 1 <= a < n and re-run the test. Since two tests are independent, there is at most 6.25% (=![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4^{-2})) chance to declare the number as a prime. We can continue doing this until there is little chance of declaring it as a prime. 

### Deterministic primality test

According to the [results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller–Rabin_primality_test#Testing_against_small_sets_of_bases), when numbers are not extremely large, a deterministic Miller-Rabin primality test can be implemented as below.

```python
def is_prime_miller_rabin(n):
    """ A deterministic Miller-Rabin primality test
    return if n is a prime for n < 2^64
    """
    if n >= 18446744073709551616:
        raise ValueError("n is too big")
    if n <= 1: return False
    if n <= 3: return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0: return False

    # find s and odd d such that n = d * 2^s + 1
    s, d = 1, n - 1
    while d % 2 == 0:
        s += 1
        d //= 2

    def is_composite(a):
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            return False
        for r in range(1, s):
            if pow(a, d * 2 ** r, n) == n - 1:
                return False
        return True

    for a in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41]:
        if a >= n: break
        if is_composite(a):
            return False
    return True
```


### Bonus
A much easier and faster way is to install the [miller-rabin](https://pypi.org/project/miller-rabin/) package. We'll get the answer in 0.05s!
