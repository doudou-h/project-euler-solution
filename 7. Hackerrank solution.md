## [Hackerrank Project Euler #7](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler007/problem) 
### Question
Given `T` numbers, for each number `N`, find out what is the `N-th` prime number?

Constraints:
- `1 <= T <= 10^3`
- `1 <= N <= 10^4`

### Solution
Similar to [Hackerrank Project Euler #4](./4.%20Hackerrank%20solution.md), the solution is to cache the prime numbers. Notice that `N <= 10^4` and [PrimePages](https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/10000.txt) tells us that the 10,000th prime is `104,729`. Therefore, we can use [Sieve method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to find all prime numbers up to `104,729` 

```python
from math import sqrt

def sieve(n):
    """generate all primes <= n"""
    a = [1] * (n + 1)
    a[0], a[1] = 0, 0
    for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if a[i]:
            j = i * i
            while j <= n:
                a[j] = 0
                j += i
    return [i for i in range(n + 1) if a[i]]

T = int(input())
p = sieve(104729)
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    print(p[N - 1])
```
