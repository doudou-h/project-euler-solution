## **[205. Dice Game](https://projecteuler.net/problem=205)**

### Question
Peter has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4.

Colin has six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Peter and Colin roll their dice and compare totals: the highest total wins. The result is a draw if the totals are equal.

What is the probability that Pyramidal Pete beats Cubic Colin? Give your answer rounded to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg

### Solution
```python
def p205():

    def sum_count(a):
        d = defaultdict(int)
        for x in product(*a):
            d[sum(x)] += 1
        return d

    fours = [[1, 2, 3, 4] for i in range(9)]
    sixes = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] for i in range(6)]
    d4, d6 = sum_count(fours), sum_count(sixes)

    ans = 0
    for k4 in d4.keys():
        for k6 in range(1, k4):
            ans += d4[k4] * d6[k6]
    ans /= (6 ** 6 * 4 ** 9)
    return ans
```

### Answer
`0.5731441`
