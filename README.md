### What I have learnt
I have learnt a lot through solving problems on Project Euler. Here is a short list. I write them down in my own words to make sure that I truly understand them. 

#### Maths
- [Miller–Rabin primality test](/58.%20Miller–Rabin%20primality%20test.md)
- [Pentagonal number theorem](/78.%20Pentagonal%20number%20theorem.md)

### Interesting problems
#### Games
- [54. Poker hands](./54.%20Poker%20hands.md)
- [93. Arithmetic expressions](./93.%20Arithmetic%20expressions.md) ([24 Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game#24®_Game))
- [96. Su Doku](./96.%20Su%20Doku.md)
- [692. Siegbert and Jo](./692.%20Siegbert%20and%20Jo.md) ([Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim))


### Why do I work on Project Euler? 

It's fun and challenging. 

### How to solve a new problem? 

- #### Follow intuition

- **Start from small numbers and look for a pattern**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is probably the most important one to solve problems on Project Euler. They're maths problems. Maths has its beauty and has **patterns**.

- #### Break the problem down into smaller parts 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This coincides the idea of writing clean code.

### How to "cheat"?

- [Pypy](https://www.pypy.org/features.html)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get speedup with minimal effort. Pypy can potentially reduce python execution time from one hour to one or a few minutes. That makes an almost unbearable solution not too bad in the end.
