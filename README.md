### What I have learned
I have learned a lot through solving problems on Project Euler. Here is a short list. I write them down in my own words to make sure that I truly understand them. 

#### Maths
- [Miller–Rabin primality test](/58.%20Miller–Rabin%20primality%20test.md)
- [Pentagonal number theorem](/78.%20Pentagonal%20number%20theorem.md)

### Interesting problems
#### Games
- [54. Poker hands](./54.%20Poker%20hands.md)
- [93. Arithmetic expressions](./93.%20Arithmetic%20expressions.md) ([24 Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game#24®_Game))
- [96. Su Doku](./96.%20Su%20Doku.md)
- [692. Siegbert and Jo](./692.%20Siegbert%20and%20Jo.md) ([Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim))


### Why do I work on Project Euler? 

It's fun and challenging. 

### How to solve a new problem? 

- #### Follow intuition

- **Start from small numbers and look for a pattern**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is probably the most important one to solve problems on Project Euler. They're maths problems. Maths has its beauty and has **patterns**.

- #### Break the problem down into smaller parts 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This coincides the idea of writing clean code.

### How to "cheat"?

- [Pypy](https://www.pypy.org/features.html)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to its just-in-time (JIT) compilation by translating python code to machine code, pypy can significantly improve performance. It works especially well for recursion problem from my experience, which can potentially reduce execution time from one hour to a few minutes. That makes an unbearable solution not too bad in the end. See more [here](https://realpython.com/pypy-faster-python/).
