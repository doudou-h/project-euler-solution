### Why do I work on Project Euler? 

#### Short answer
It's fun and challenging. 

#### Long answer
...


### How to solve a new problem? 

- #### Follow your intuition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. ...

- #### Start from small numbers and look for a pattern
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. [85. Counting rectangles](./85.%20Counting%20rectangles.md) or when recursive relation is not so obvious

- #### Break the problem down into smaller parts 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This coincides the idea of writing clean code.
