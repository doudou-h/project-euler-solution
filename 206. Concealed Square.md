## **[206. Concealed Square](https://projecteuler.net/problem=206)**

### Question
Find the unique positive integer whose square has the form 1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_0,
where each “_” is a single digit.

### Solution
The square is a 19-digit number starting with `1`, 
which suggests the answer is a 10-digit number not greater than `int(sqrt(2) * 10**9)`. 
Also, the square ends with `0` suggesting that the last digit of the answer is `0`. 
Then the form becomes 1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_900. Therefore the second-to-last digit is either `3` or `7`.

```python
import re

pattern = "1\d2\d3\d4\d5\d6\d7\d8\d900"

def p206():
    limit = int(sqrt(2) * 10**9)
    first = '1'
    for second in '43210':
        for middle in product('0123456789', repeat=6):
            s = ''.join(middle)
            n = int(first + second + s + '30')
            if n > limit: break
            if re.fullmatch(pattern, str(n * n)):
                return n

            n = int(first + second + s + '70')
            if n > limit: break
            if re.fullmatch(pattern, str(n * n)):
                return n
```

### Answer 
`1389019170`
