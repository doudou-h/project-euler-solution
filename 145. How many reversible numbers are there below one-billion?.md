## **[145. How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?]()**

### Question
Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [ n + reverse(n) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409, and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either n or reverse(n).

There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?

### Solution
Solved it with pencil and paper using the table below

| a + b                  | #(a,b) |
|------------------------|:------:|
| 3, 5, 7, 9 (start/end) |   20   |
| 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (middle) |   30   |
| 11, 13, 15, 17         |   20   |
| 0, 2, 4, 6, 8          |   25   |

For even n, have a look at 2, 4, 6, it's easy to generalise that ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(n)=20\times&space;30^{\frac{n-2}{2}}&space;\texttt{&space;with&space;}&space;f(2)=20)

For odd n:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If n % 4 == 1, f(n) = 0

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If n = 3, assume that the number is `abc`, then `a + c` can only be 11, 13, 15 or 17 and `b` is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. So in total 20 x 5 = 100

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If n = 7, assume that the number is `abcdefg`, then `a + g` can only be 11, 13, 15 or 17 and 
`f + b` is 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8. So in total 20 x 25 x f(3) = 50000

I believe it's easy to generalise for n % 4 == 3 as well, but I stopped here... :)

|   n  |  2 |  3  |  4  | 5 |   6   |   7   |    8   | 9 |
|:----:|:--:|:---:|:---:|:-:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:-:|
| f(n) | 20 | 100 | 600 | 0 | 18000 | 50000 | 540000 | 0 |
